Once the repo is cloned to your local storage, simply run node index.js to start the flaschcards. Each question has one correct answer. Enter the number of the answer you wish to select. You will be informed whether you're answer was correct or not. Once all the questions have been answered the game ends and a message will appear that informs you of the percentage of correct answers.
